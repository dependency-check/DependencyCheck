Dependency-Check-Gradle
=========

**Working in progress**

This is a DependencyCheck gradle plugin designed for project which use Gradle as build script.

Dependency-Check is a utility that attempts to detect publicly disclosed vulnerabilities contained within project dependencies. It does this by determining if there is a Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) identifier for a given dependency. If found, it will generate a report linking to the associated CVE entries.
