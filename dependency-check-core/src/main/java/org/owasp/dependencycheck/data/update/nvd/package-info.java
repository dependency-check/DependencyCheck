/**
 * Contains classes used to parse the NVD CVE XML file.<br/><br/>
 *
 * The basic use is that the Importer is called to import an NVD CVE file. The Importer instantiates an Indexer object (which
 * extends Index). The Indexer creates a partial-unmarshalling SAX parser (implemented in the NvdCveXmlFilter) that extracts
 * VulnerabilityTypes (aka Entry) from the NVD CVE data file and stores these into a Lucene Index.
