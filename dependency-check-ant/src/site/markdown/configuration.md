Configuration
====================
To configure the dependency-check task you can add it to a target and include a
file based [resource collection](http://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/resources.html#collection)
such as a [FileSet](http://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/fileset.html), [DirSet](http://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/dirset.html),
or [FileList](http://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/filelist.html) that includes
the project's dependencies.

```xml
<target name="dependency-check" description="Dependency-Check Analysis">
    <dependency-check applicationname="Hello World"
                      reportoutputdirectory="${basedir}"
                      reportformat="ALL">

        <fileset dir="lib">
            <include name="**/*.jar"/>
        </fileset>
    </dependency-check>
</target>
```

Configuration
====================
The following properties can be set on the dependency-check-maven plugin.

Property             | Description                        | Default Value
---------------------|------------------------------------|------------------
autoUpdate           | Sets whether auto-updating of the NVD CVE/CPE data is enabled. It is not recommended that this be turned to false. | true
updateOnly           | If set to true only the update phase of dependency-check will be executed; no scan will be executed and no report will be generated. | false
externalReport       | When using as a Site plugin this parameter sets whether or not the external report format should be used. | false
outputDirectory      | The location to write the report(s). Note, this is not used if generating the report as part of a `mvn site` build | 'target'
failBuildOnCVSS      | Specifies if the build should be failed if a CVSS score above a specified level is identified. The default is 11 which means since the CVSS scores are 0-10, by default the build will never fail.         | 11
format               | The report format to be generated (HTML, XML, VULN, ALL). This configuration option has no affect if using this within the Site plugin unless the externalReport is set to true. | HTML
logFile              | The file path to write verbose logging information. | &nbsp;
suppressionFile      | The file path to the XML suppression file \- used to suppress [false positives](../suppression.html) | &nbsp;
proxyServer          | The Proxy Server.                  | &nbsp;
proxyPort            | The Proxy Port.                    | &nbsp;
proxyUsername        | Defines the proxy user name.       | &nbsp;
proxyPassword        | Defines the proxy password.        | &nbsp;
connectionTimeout    | The URL Connection Timeout.        | &nbsp;

Analyzer Configuration
====================
The following properties are used to configure the various file type analyzers.
These properties can be used to turn off specific analyzers if it is not needed.
Note, that specific analyzers will automatically disable themselves if no file
types that they support are detected - so specifically disabling them may not
be needed.

Property                | Description                                                               | Default Value
------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------
archiveAnalyzerEnabled  | Sets whether the Archive Analyzer will be used.                           | true
zipExtensions           | A comma-separated list of additional file extensions to be treated like a ZIP file, the contents will be extracted and analyzed. | &nbsp;
jarAnalyzer             | Sets whether the Jar Analyzer will be used.                                   | true
centralAnalyzerEnabled  | Sets whether the Central Analyzer will be used. **Disabling this analyzer is not recommended as it could lead to false negatives (e.g. libraries that have vulnerabilities may not be reported correctly).** If this analyzer is being disabled there is a good chance you also want to disable the Nexus Analyzer (see below).                                  | true
nexusAnalyzerEnabled    | Sets whether Nexus Analyzer will be used. This analyzer is superceded by the Central Analyzer; however, you can configure this to run against a Nexus Pro installation. | true
nexusUrl                | Defines the Nexus web service endpoint (example http://domain.enterprise/nexus/service/local/). If not set the Nexus Analyzer will be disabled. | &nbsp;
nexusUsesProxy          | Whether or not the defined proxy should be used when connecting to Nexus. | true
nuspecAnalyzerEnabled   | Sets whether or not the .NET Nuget Nuspec Analyzer will be used.          | true
assemblyAnalyzerEnabled | Sets whether or not the .NET Assembly Analyzer should be used.            | true
pathToMono              | The path to Mono for .NET assembly analysis on non-windows systems.       | &nbsp;

Advanced Configuration
====================
The following properties can be configured in the plugin. However, they are less frequently changed. One exception
may be the cvedUrl properties, which can be used to host a mirror of the NVD within an enterprise environment.

Property             | Description                                                             | Default Value
