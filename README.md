Dependency-Check
================

Dependency-Check is a utility that attempts to detect publicly disclosed vulnerabilities contained within project dependencies. It does this by determining if there is a Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) identifier for a given dependency. If found, it will generate a report linking to the associated CVE entries.

Documentation and links to production binary releases can be found on the [github pages](http://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/). Additionally, more information about the architecture and ways to extend dependency-check can be found on the [wiki].

### Ant Task

For instructions on the use of the Ant Task, please see the [dependency-check-ant github page](http://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/dependency-check-ant/installation.html).

Development Usage
-------------
The following instructions outline how to compile and use the current snapshot. While every intention is to maintain a stable snapshot it is recommended
that the release versions listed above be used.

Note, currently the install goal may take a long time to execute the integration tests. However, if this takes more then 30 minutes it is likely that the
download of data from the NVD is having an issue. This issue is still being researched and a solution should be published soon.

On *nix
```
$ mvn install
$ ./dependency-check-cli/target/release/bin/dependency-check.sh -h
$ ./dependency-check-cli/target/release/bin/dependency-check.sh --app Testing --out . --scan ./src/test/resources
```
On Windows
```
> mvn install
> dependency-check-cli/target/release/bin/dependency-check.bat -h
> dependency-check-cli/target/release/bin/dependency-check.bat --app Testing --out . --scan ./src/test/resources
```

Then load the resulting 'DependencyCheck-Report.html' into your favorite browser.
